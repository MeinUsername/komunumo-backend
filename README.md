## The Name

*Komunumo* is an [esperanto](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) noun with a meaning of *community*.

## Configuration

In your home directory create a new directory with the name `.komunumo` (yes, the name of the directory starts with a dot, which hides the directory on unix systems by default). Inside of this directory create a text file with the name `komunumo.cfg` which you can use to configure *Komunumo*. This configuration file can contain as many empty lines and comments (lines starting with a `#` character) as you like.

### Example configuration file
```
# Security
token.signing.key = very secret text 
token.expiration.time = 480

# Administrator
admin.firstname = John
admin.lastname = Doe
admin.email = john.doe@mydomain.com

# SMTP Server information
smtp.server = mail.mydomain.com
smtp.port = 465
smtp.user = no-reply@mydomain.com
smtp.password = very secret password
smtp.useSSL = true
smtp.from = no-reply@mydomain.com

# Server
server.baseURL = https://mydomain.com
```

Most configuration options are self-descriptive. The `token.signing.key` is just text like a password which is used to sign the JSON Web Token with a private key. The `token.expiration.time` is a number specifying the time a JSON Web Token is valid until it expires (in minutes, 480 minutes are 8 hours = about 8 hours after a successful authorization the user has to authorize again). The `server.baseURL` is used as a prefix for automatically generated links like in the `Location` header of a response and in emails.
